## Graphical Abstract

## Summary
During development, distinct progenitors contribute to the nephrons versus the ureteric epithelium of the
kidney. Indeed, previous human pluripotent stem-cell-derived models of kidney tissue either contain
nephrons or pattern specifically to the ureteric epithelium. By re-analyzing the transcriptional distinction
between distal nephron and ureteric epithelium in human fetal kidney, we show here that, while existing
nephron-containing kidney organoids contain distal nephron epithelium and no ureteric epithelium, this
distal nephron segment alone displays significant in vitro plasticity and can adopt a ureteric epithelial tip
identity when isolated and cultured in defined conditions. “Induced”
ureteric epithelium cultures can be
cryopreserved, serially passaged without loss of identity, and transitioned toward a collecting duct fate.
Cultures harboring loss-of-function mutations in PKHD1 also recapitulate the cystic phenotype associated
with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.
